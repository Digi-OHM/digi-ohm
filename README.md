I'm **OHM (Nattawat)** --- a Full Stack Developer who enjoys turning
ideas into real, working systems.

I like building applications that don't just look good, but run reliably
in production.\
From designing clean REST APIs and structuring databases to deploying
with Docker, I enjoy the full journey from concept to deployment.

Over the past 2 years, I've worked on enterprise-level systems focused
on scalability, performance, and maintainable architecture.
